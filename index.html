<mark>Varo is a FinTech company that helps Americans establish financial security through high yield savings and no fee banking.</mark> I wanted to make an impact with a team that delivers financial reassurance to all customer segments, especially those who have been denied financial opportunities from bigger banks.
<p>
As the <b>Brand Content Intern</b>, I’ve developed <b>marketing messages and creative content</b> that have aimed to inform customers of the financial tools that Varo offers. The content I created consisted of video productions that shared stories of customer experiences and social media designs that helped establish Varo’s rebrand and credibility.  I also tweaked Android and iOS product screens using Sketch for rebrand purposes. Furthermore, <mark> I’ve helped strategize start-to-finish marketing plans for product launches as well as co-managed sweepstakes and contests to engage customers with the company’s mission. So far my efforts have assisted Varo in </mark><b> gaining 2000+ followers on Instagram, increasing overall social media engagement, illustrating customer segments to investors, and launching new products. </b></p>

Last year, I traveled through parts of Asia and it came to my attention that there were many Asian communities in demand of basic necessities. After my time abroad, I wanted to help solve some of the issues I became aware of, which included the <mark>safety of young women, hygenic water, higher education, disability rights, financial literacy, and more.</mark> Give2Asia, a US-based nonprofit organization, has a mission to <b>drive social impact in local communities across Asia</b>. I had the opportunity to become Give2Asia’s <b>Marketing and Communications Intern </b> to help bridge philanthropic groups with their target communities.
</p>

<p>
I directly impacted philanthropic partners by providing them with social media content including videos, animations, and graphics to raise awareness about their mission. After <mark>conducting interviews </mark>with Asia-based field advisors, I created <mark>informative blog posts </mark> to showcase their global efforts. <mark>Analyzing and communicating Mailchimp metrics and testing keywords on Google Adwords</mark> helped me better understand how partners were responding to Give2Asia's efforts and messaging, which helped me select key words that would bring individuals, philanthropic groups, and corporations onto Give2Asia's website.

I wanted to <b>impact local communities in Singapore,</b> a young and modern country ranked as one of the richest countries. Because most of Singapore’s citizens live in high-rise apartments, many residents have digital smartlocks, which have increasingly pushed conventional locks out of the market. I was lucky to contribute to this IoT evolution as a <b>Digital Marketing Intern at Igloohome.</b>
</p>
<p>
In the short 7 weeks of my study abroad internship, I helped create marketing videos, which have now reached over <b>17,000 views</b> combined. I spoke on behalf of Igloohome to explain key features of some of their top products and I gave demonstrations on how their smartlocks work. At tech events, I <b>promoted and pitched</b> their smartlocks to <b>increase sales and brand awareness.</b>  Futhermore, I managed product giveaways on Airbnb’s Finest Hosts Facebook Group to strengthen Igloohome’s global presence and relationship with customers.
